# Enshrouded Mod Menu — Shape the Fog, Rewrite the Journey

In **Enshrouded**, the world breathes through mist. Ruins whisper. The Shroud presses in like a memory you can’t quite shake. Survival here is not loud heroism—it is patience, preparation, and quiet mastery.

This **Enshrouded Mod Menu** is built for those who want to *understand* the land before it devours them. Not to rush past the danger, but to bend it gently, testing limits, exploring freely, and building without constraint.

## 🌲 Overview — What the Mod Menu Unlocks

This is not a single-purpose cheat.
It is a **sandbox of control**.

The mod menu runs as an external tool with an in-game overlay, offering real-time toggles for survival mechanics, combat values, and world interaction. You decide how close to the edge you want to walk.

Core philosophy:

* Modular features (use one or all)
* Instant enable / disable
* Designed for solo & cooperative PvE
* Minimal performance impact
* Clean, readable interface

The fog still rolls in—but now, you choose how it feels.

## 🛡 Survival & Player State Controls

The land is harsh. Sometimes, you need room to breathe.

### ❤️ Core Survival Options

* God Mode (full invulnerability toggle)
* Infinite health & stamina
* Hunger & thirst freeze
* No poison / no Shroud damage
* Temperature resistance (cold & heat)

Perfect for exploration deep into corrupted zones or learning dangerous areas without constant resets.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Survival options can be bound to hotkeys, allowing quick toggles when switching between exploration and combat.

## 🌫 Final Thoughts

Enshrouded is a world of pressure and poetry.

To learn.
To build.
To wander farther than fear would normally allow.

The fog still surrounds you.
But now, it answers when you speak.
